# JavaScript Code Quiz

A timed, multiple-choice JavaScript fundamentals quiz that stores high scores.

To beat the clock, users must correctly answer all questions--each incorrect answer loses them 5 seconds! Winners can store their initials and view a list of high scores before playing again. With a simple and responsive design, the quiz is easy to expand with additional questions and an adjusted timer value.
